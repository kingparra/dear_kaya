Dear Kaya,

I never meant to hurt you. I'm sorry I did. I see now that I asked too
much of you, not for who you are, but for who I thought you should be.
I wanted a level of commitment and closeness that wasn't fair to expect.

What has always been true is that I was sincere. I never manipulated
you, and I've always cared for you with my whole heart. But my fear
of abandonment, and my idealization of you, turned into pressure I put
on you without realizing it. That's something I've learned from, and 
I won't repeat.

After we slept together, I idealized our bond as an unconditional
affection that could erase my fear of abandonment. To me, it seemed
like you projected a deep distrust of men onto me.
We didn't see each other anymore.

I understand now that you weren't invested in me the same way
I was in you. That doesn't make what we shared less meaningful. You
still gave me so much: acceptance, encouragement, friends, laughter,
and safety. Kaya, you have brought so much beauty to my life.
I'm deeply grateful for that incredible gift, and I'll
always remember it. You've changed me forever.

I love you as you are. Not as an ideal, not as a bond you never asked to
carry, but as Kaya. Someone who brought light and joy into my life. And
I don't need more than that anymore. Every moment is a gift freely given.

I want to apologize to Noah. I know I made mistakes, and I regret
the times I crossed a line. I never intended to. I respect him, and
I respect your relationship. I wish you both happiness. Truly.

If there's space for me in your life, I'd love for us to find a
friendship that's lighter and freer, where we can simply have fun
together, without the weight of impossible expectations.

With love,

    Evie

PS: I think the hormones are working. Instead of stepping back
dispassionately like I usually do, I went on a fucking spirit
quest to sort this shit out.
