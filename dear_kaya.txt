Dear Kaya,

I never meant to hurt you. If I did, I'm sorry. I see now that I asked too
much of you, not for who you are, but for who I thought you should be. I
wanted a level of commitment and closeness that wasn't fair to expect.

What has always been true is that I was sincere. I never manipulated
you, and I've always cared for you with my whole heart. But my fear
of abandonment, and my idealization of you, turned into pressure I put
on you without realizing it. That's something I've learned from, and I
won't repeat.

I also understand now that you werenâ€™t invested in me the same way
I was in you. That doesn't make what we shared less meaningful. You
still gave me so much: acceptance, encouragement, friends, laughter,
and safety. I'm deeply grateful for incredible gift, and I'll carry it
with me. You changed my life forever.

I love you as you are. Not as an ideal, not as a bond you never asked to
carry, but as Kaya. Someone who brought light and joy into my life. And
I don't need more than that anymore.

I wish you well with Noah. Truly. And if there's space for me in your
life, I'd love for us to find a friendship that's lighter and freer,
where we can simply have fun together, without the weight of impossible
expectations.

With love,

    Evie
