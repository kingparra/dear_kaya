Dear Kaya,

I never meant to hurt you. I'm sorry I did. I see now that I asked too
much of you, not for who you are, but for who I thought you should be.
I wanted a level of commitment and closeness that wasn't fair to expect.

What has always been true is that I was sincere. I never manipulated
you, and I've always cared for you with my whole heart. But my fear
of abandonment, and my idealization of you, turned into pressure I put
on you without realizing it. That's something I've learned from, and 
I won't repeat.

After we slept together, I idealized our bond as something
that could erase my fear of abandonment. I think both
of us brought our past hurts into it. You with your distrust, and
me with my fears. And it made it harder for us to see each other.
But I hope we can, now.

I understand now that you weren't invested in me the same way
I was in you. That doesn't make what we shared less meaningful. You
still gave me so much: acceptance, encouragement, friends, laughter,
and safety. 

You introduced me to all of your friends. We shared
wild excitement. You saw some of my deepest wounds.
You encouraged me to be brave. And, for a while, you saw me as myself,
as I truly am. For the first time in my life.

You even gave me a name.

Kaya, you have brought so much beauty to my life.
I'm deeply grateful for these incredible gifts, and I'll
always remember them. You've changed my life forever.
Not just through memories, but by helping to shape the person
that I now am.

I love you as you are. Not as an ideal, not as a bond you never asked to
carry, but as Kaya. Someone who brought light and joy into my life. And
I don't need more than that anymore. Every moment is a gift freely given.

I want to apologize to Noah. I know I made mistakes, and I regret
the times I crossed a line. I never intended to. I respect him, and
I respect your relationship. I wish you both happiness. Truly.

Before I close this letter, I have to acknolwedge something that hurt
me. When you began to withdraw, I didn't understand why. Because you
didn't communicate, I couldn't know where the boundaries were, and
that left me feeling left in the dark. In an attempt to compensate
for this new sense of distance, I piled on more attention until it
became overwhelming. Then, in your last message, your description
of me as manipulative cut deeply, because that's not who I am.
I forgive you, but I can't pretend it didn't hurt.

Kaya, if there's space for me in your life, I'd love for us to find a
friendship that's lighter and freer, where we can simply have fun
together, without the weight of impossible expectations.

Now, I can say that I finally feel free.
And I hope you feel free, too, my dearest friend.

With truth and love,

    Evie

PS: I think the hormones are working. Instead of stepping back
dispassionately like I usually do, I went on a fucking spirit
quest to sort this shit out. I'm going to eat some cheesecake
and cry, now.
