Dear Kaya,

I never meant to hurt you. I'm sorry I did. I see now that I wanted
a level of closeness that wasn't fair to expect.

What has always been true is that I was sincere.
I've always been honest, and I cared for you with my whole heart.
But my fear of abandonment, and my idealization of you, turned into
pressure I put on you without realizing it. That's something I've
learned from, and won't repeat.

In my need for security, I idealized our bond as something it's not.
A bond where I could unapologitecally be my rawest self.
An unconditional friendship where instead of trust, we had faith
in each other, because we'd seen each others truth.
A cure to my insecurity. One where I'd never be abandoned again.

But after we slept together, things changed.
You saw me differently. And where I saw myself
as conflicted, you saw signs of deceit.

When you distanced yourself without a word,
I showed more affection to compensate for my fear.
More checking in. Involving you in silly errands.
Little gifts. Too much pressure.

I wish we had asked each other what we needed directly.
If you had told me you needed space, I would have respected it.
If I had asked you why our conversations became so guarded,
I could have started to understand how I no longer saw you.

I understand now that you weren't invested in me
the same way I was in you.
But that doesn't make what we shared less meaningful.
You still gave me so much.

You introduced me to every last one of your friends.
We shared wild excitement.
You saw some of my deepest wounds.
You encouraged me to be brave.
And, for a while, you saw me as myself, as I truly am.
For the first time in my life, someone saw me as Evie.
You even gave me that name.

Kaya, you have brought so much beauty to my life.
You've changed me forever, not just through memories,
but by allowing me to be true.

Now, I love you as you are. Not as an ideal,
not as a bond you never asked to carry, but as Kaya.
And I don't need more than that anymore.

Noah, I'm sorry. I know I made mistakes. I sent mixed
messages, said some gross things, and when Kaya showed
up less in my life, I even feared you.
But I never intended to disrespect you.
I do respect you, and I want you both to be happy together.

Kaya, if there's space left for me in your life, I'd love for us
to find a friendship that's lighter and freer, where we can simply
have fun, without the weight of impossible expectations.
Where every moment is a gift, not an obligation.

Now, I can say I finally feel free.
And I hope you feel free, too, my dearest friend.
Because I love you.

With truth and love,

    Evie

PS: I think the hormones are working. Instead of stepping back
like I usually do, I went on a fucking spirit quest to sort
this shit out. I'm gonna eat cheesecake and cry, now.

PPS: I learned a new joke. Two hunters are in the woods when one falls to the
ground, seemingly dead. The other hunter calls 911 and says, "My friend is
dead, what can I do?" The operator replies, "Stay calm. First, make sure he's
dead." There's a moment of silence, then a gunshot. The hunter comes back on
the line: "Okay, now what?"
