Dear Kaya,

I've been spending a lot of time thinking about our relationship.
Not just the rift that's formed between us,
but the whole arch of our time together.
First as roomates, then as friends, the partying,
those three nights we spent together,
how I put you on a pedstal, how I sook intimiacy
romantically, how I struggled to get over it,
how I then sook greater intimacy as a friend,
how I desperately clawed at you in my anxiety,
and finally how my care and adoration were interpreted
as manipulation towards an ulterior motive.

You are someone who's seen me at my rawest.
Someone who knows more of my pain than anyone else.
Someone who showed me safety in vulnerability.
And allowed me to be raw.
You went out of your way to connect me with all of your friends.
You are someone who gave me joy.
Someone who listened with all her heart.
Someone who encourage me to be brave.
The first person who saw me as myself.

Thank you for this beautiful gift.
It's made me a stronger person.
Less afraid to be human.
I will carry that with me for the rest of my life.

Because of that,
I felt you were a friend I would step through fire for.
A connection that's once in a lifetime.
Someone I could die for.
Someone irreplacable.

And you are.

But you also never cared about me the same way I care about you.
And I realize that now.

Over the last few months, I deeply feared abandonment.
As you distanced me without explanation I tried to compensate by
showing you increasingly more affection.
When what you really needed was space.
My attempts to repair the rift in our friendship backfired spectacularly.

After we slept together, or maybe from the beginning,
you projected your deep fear of men onto me.
As I struggled with my desire for intimacy, I did some disgusting things.
I sent a text message that I was horny and jealous the first night
you and Noah got together.
As soon as I sent it, I knew I'd regret that for the rest of my life.
But I was never insincere.
Never manipulative.
Even when I was conflicted, or possessive, I was always truthful with you.
I been the truest friend I can.

With the exception of that one text,
I've never done anything to disrespected Noah.
I even showed support for both of you at the start.
On the first night you were together I told him that you liked him,
and encouraged him to take a chance.

I have lost so many people in my life.
During my childhood, a certian manipulator would
turn my the people around me against each other,
make them hate each other,
isolate them,
convince them she was her only friend,
create a dependency on her,
put them through trials of loyalty,
break them,
and finally impose the control,
which she used to perpetrate horrors
that still haunt me every night.

Since you never told me that you needed distance,
I assumed the worst.
I saw that Noah was possessive.
That you were increasingly isolated.
The distance and insincerity of your interactions with me.
How Noah would physically position himself between us at gatherings.
I heard that you two were either love bombed or fighting.
And I assumed the worst.
It felt like it was happening again.
In reality, fighting is a normal part of a relationship,
and you were just tired of my constant attention.
I'm ashamed that I let my fear warp my perception of Noah.
That's not who he is.

When you wouldn't explain why you were angry, I felt confused and discarded.
When you punished me for crossing a boundary that you never
expressed, I felt unjustly punished.
Kaya, you were the first person I felt completly authentic with.
So when you characerized me as a manipulator in your last texts,
I started to question if you've ever seen me at all.

At this point, we both have broken trust.
I don't think I can be around you anymore.
But at least I can tell you that I've told you the whole truth.
Which is the one thing you didn't give me.

I'll love you forever, Kaya, my dearest friend.
There's no one else like you.
And there never will be.

Sincerely,

    Evie
