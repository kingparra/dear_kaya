Questions
*********

Did Kaya ever see me as a friend she could walk through fire for, like I saw her?

How specifically did I drive her away?

Did I ever try to use her? I can't forgive myself if I did.

What did Noah mean when he said he felt disrespected by me?

Was I right to be angry after Wes' birthday party?

Why was Noah so intimidating to me?

Is Noah a controling person, or was my suspicion purely driven by fear?

What does Kaya think of me now?

What do I want from her?

How can I see us as friends from now on, after this rift?

What role did I play in our mutual lack of communication?

Did she owe it to me to do more to be honest? Was the way she lashed out unfair, or a natural response given the pressure I put on her?

Does she see me as an honest person? I tried so hard to be a good friend. Does she see that?

Does her past trauma cause her to see me as a monster, like her abuser, or mine?

Why haven't I been able to focus on work or school for the last two weeks?

Did she ever like me personally, or did she just enjoy the excitement of the places I brought her to?

What does she value about me, and how can I give her that without pressure?

What do I try want from Kaya in the future? Light friendship, deeper trust, or simply peace?

How can I express my needs in ways that give others room to breathe?

How can I balance my need for honesty with respect for other peoples limits?

Did I also push for intimacy with Brian they way I did with Kaya?
...yes, the answer is yes. I once asked him if I can come over and
platonically cuddle while watching TV. Although he was receptive at
the moment, I think it was crossing a line. I hope I haven't pushed
him away, too. It would hurt to lose both of my best friends.
